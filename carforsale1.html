<p>The information in this guide is based on findings from version 0.1.42-0.1.44. The game is early access and things are subject to change as the game&rsquo;s mechanics are tweaked/balanced.</p>
<p>This guide will predominantly speak as though you&rsquo;ve unlocked the Better Bargain 2 and Best Price skills, the latter of which can help you determine the exact value of your car and is very important in pricing efficiently instead of guessing.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><span id="What_Primarily_Influences_Value">What Primarily Influences Value?</span></h3>
<p>Almost all the modifiers to value only affect the prices at which vehicles are sold to you, not when you sell to a customer. When a car is created, it is given a base value. Damage, dirt, mileage, features are added onto the car randomly at the time it is sold and that affects the seller&rsquo;s asking price, which is capped at the base value but can be much lower if the car is in rough shape.</p>
<p>Once the car is in your hands, however, the car is valued at the base value, which can never be lower than what you paid for it. Thus, buying beat up, badly painted cars with high mileage will earn you a huge profit while pristine cars with low mileage and fancy features only a modest profit.</p>
<p>Cleaning and refueling a car does nothing for value. Adding a picture or title to your posting does nothing as well. Repairing, repainting, and tuning a car adds very little value. Apart from getting achievements, if your goal is to profit quickly or climb the leaderboards then you should just sell cars as-is (or be a cheater and save scum poker, whatever floats your boat).</p>
<p>An example car&rsquo;s sell value:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fiyay 131</li>
<li>71.5k km mileage</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>10% dmg 35% painted: 195.5-363.2k.</li>
<li>0% dmg ($150 repair) 0% painted ($175 respray): 195.9-364k.</li>
<li>Tuning Racing,ABS,Turbo,NOS ($1240): 196.9-365.7k.</li>
</ul>
<p>So all that work fixing up the car, repainting it, and adding cool features only netted us an extra 2.5k max sale price at the cost of 1.5k, or an extra 1k profit at best. In that same time we could have bought 2-3 more cars and thrown them in our lot.</p>
<p>And to salt the wound, driving the fixed/tuned car into the car lot walls until engine breaks.</p>
<p>70% damage: 196.2k &ndash; 364.3k &mdash; a loss of only 700-1400 for totally trashing a perfect car.</p>
<p>Now onto the fun part, selling people our dirty clunkers for high prices!</p>
