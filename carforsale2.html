<p><strong>TL;DR Version</strong></p>
<p>If a customer accepts your price without bargaining, that means they were willing to pay more.</p>
<p>If a lowballer is offering less than half of your listing price, you&rsquo;re way overpricing your car.</p>

<p>The Best Price skill gives you this gauge when you go to list a car for sale, which is vague, but actually allows you to determine the exact value of your car when you know what it means. Here&rsquo;s what it actually means:</p>
<p>The price gauge shows the value of the car from 70% to 130%</p>
<ul>
<li>70%-85% Lower Price</li>
<li>85%-93% Below Average</li>
<li>93%-107% Average</li>
<li>107%-115% Above Average</li>
<li>115%-130% High Price</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two types of customers that enter your lot, good customers and lowballers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good customers offer you 93%-107% of the car&rsquo;s value (the average range).</li>
<li>Lowballers offer you 65.1-88.35% (70-95% of 93%).</li>
</ul>
<p>You will always get 3-5 lowballers per day. The amount of good customers you get depends on your asking price.</p>
<ul>
<li>&lt;110%: 6-7</li>
<li>&lt;120%: 5-6</li>
<li>&lt;130%: 2-3</li>
<li>&lt;140%: 1</li>
<li>=140%: 0</li>
</ul>
<p>For selling, bargain skill lets you ask for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amateur (1): 7% more</li>
<li>Apprentice (2): 12% more</li>
<li>Master (3): 17% more</li>
</ul>
<p>This is slightly lower than when buying, which is 5%/10%/20%. Bargaining is subject to rounding, so always add or remove a little bit when buying or selling.</p>
<p>You cannot negotiate higher than your original asking price, so if you want maximum value then it&rsquo;s in your best interest to slightly overprice your cars &mdash; to the extent that you can tolerate the loss in foot traffic.</p>
<p>The max possible price you can sell a car for is the best possible offer (107%) * the best possible bargain (17%) to give you a sale price of 125.19%, or a range of 108.81-125.19% with good customers.</p>
<p>Using this knowledge, we can implement a couple of easy selling strategies with max bargain skill.</p>
<p>List all cars for the lowest orange price (115%) and bargain all customers to $1 below our asking price. We will get 5-6 good customers per day, and 62.2% of good customers will accept.</p>
<p>List all cars for the highest average price (107%) and bargain all customers to $1 below our asking price. We will get the max, 6-7 good customers per day, and 100% of them will accept. Only lowballers will refuse.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t care about money because you&rsquo;re rich, just want to sell cars for leaderboard rank? List all cars for the lowest price (70%) and even the stingiest of lowballers will accept $1 below asking price with bargain. List for 10% less than the lowest price shown and lowballers won&rsquo;t even haggle with you. 100% of customers, good and bad, will outright buy the car.</p>
<p>If you want maximum value and are willing to pull out a calculator and turn down good customers regularly, list just below 120% and you still get 5-6 good customers per day.</p>
